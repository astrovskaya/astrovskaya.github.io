Change Log
* 2.8 	Fixed bug where a slow server response would cause animations to jump.
* 2.7 	Fixed a bug where some images would stay hidden after loading. PikaChoose now works correctly in IE6/7 under strict doc types! cleaned some code to boost performance marginally.
* 2.6.2 	Image will now wait until they are fully loaded before fading in. This was a problem with user_thumbs, that would make images 'skip'
* 2.6.1 	Fixed a bug where not displaying captions caused the script to fail.
* 2.6		PikaChoose will now work properly when using jQuery.noConflict();
* 2.5 	Added support for multiple languages. Options are now defined to change the text of Play, Stop, Previous, and Next.
			User defined thumbs are now possible. Setting user_thumbs to true and defining a 'ref' attribute for images will now link to the main image to the ref rather than the src of the thumb.
			Added support for HTML in comments. Comments are now stored in a span directly after the image rather than in the title of the image.
* 2.4		Fixed a bug where SliderJS would slide photos to the right on auto play start. 
			Corrected an error that prevented the previous button from working. Photos are now properly resized on first load of page.
* 2.3		Added SliderJS support.
* 2.2.1	Fixed a bug where thumbnails would not resize on initial page load and failed to resize at all in Safari. 
* 2.2		Images now load on their own instead of waiting for the site to finish loading. This should improve performance with sites that have large pages.
* 2.1		Images can now contain links. The link url should be put in an attribute title ref
* 2.0.1	Fixed a bug where Safari would not resize the thumbnails. Improved the smoothness of loading images.
* 2.0		Re-hauled PikaChoose to be easier to implement.
* 1.0.1	Fixed bug that was preventing the auto play feature from working
